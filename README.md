## Content

Two main concepts/tools exists in the python world to cope with dependency management:

* pip - _**p**ackage **i**nstaller for **p**ython_
* virtual environments - "isolated" collection of dependencies (and other requirements)

### PIP

Pip knows two types of dependencies: normal and optional (aka [extras](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#extras)). Normal dependencies are listed with their name and the required version. Optional dependencies are listed using square brackets, e.g. `my-dependency[extra-1,extra-2]`. Calling `pip install my-dependency[extra-1,extra-2]` will install `my-dependency` and all required dependencies. In addition, everything listed in the two extras `extra-1` and `extra-2` will be installed, too.

#### Install

Install **packages** from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (**Py**thon **P**ackage **I**ndex) with the following command:

```sh
pip install pkg_name
```

**Note**: When working with _different_ python versions _on your system_, then we recommend using `pythonX -m pip install <package>` over `pip install <package>` or `pip3 install <package>`.

Will install latest version of pkg_name and all required dependencies to the current used environment (one of user env, a venv, or system-wide).

#### `requirements.txt`

You can maintain a so called [requirements file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) `requirements.txt` with pip, to document **dependency versions**.

##### Development

For development, the `requirements.txt` should only contain the top level packages. These should be listed without version information if possible. If you need a specific version try to list only a minimal version, e.g. using `pkg==1.*` to get all `1.x` versions of package `pkg`, but no `2.x` or newer. See the [requirement specifier specification](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers) for all possible allowed values. The following command uses the tool `pipdeptree` to list only the top level packages and removes the version lock of your current environment:

```sh
pipdeptree --python .venv/bin/python \
           --warn silence | \
           grep --color=none -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+' | \
           cut --delimiter='=' --fields=1 \
           > requirements.txt
```

Note, that the parameter `--python` points to a generic `venv` folder. Ensure that this parameter points to the correct location in your set-up for listing only the packages in your environment.

##### Deployment

For production, deployment, version tags and releases, a fixed and reusable environment is required. Hence, the versions of all dependencies must be documented. The following command creates/replaces a new/the existing `requirements.txt` with all packages installed in the current environment:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

#### Dependency Licenses

To document all dependencies with its version and license, you can use the package `pip-license`. In combination with a docker container, you can limit it to the "really required" dependencies:

```sh
docker run --rm --interactive --tty your-image:latest /bin/bash \
 -c "pip install --no-warn-script-location --no-cache-dir pip-licenses > /dev/null && .local/bin/pip-licenses -f markdown"
```

This will print a markdown formatted list of all dependencies. If you don't have a container ready, use the following command:

```sh
docker run --rm --interactive --tty \
      --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/requirements.txt,target=/requirements.txt \
      python:3-slim-buster \
      /bin/bash -c \
          "pip install \
          --quiet \
          --disable-pip-version-check \
          --no-warn-script-location \
          --no-cache-dir \
          -r requirements.txt \
          pip-licenses \
          > /dev/null && \
          pip-licenses -f markdown"
```

#### Update dependencies

```sh
pip install --upgrade --requirement requirements.txt
```

For fixing a certain dependency version, because you want to keep its current version, check the output of `pip list | grep package` for example, and update your requirements file accordingly.

```ini
datacube
click==7.*
geojson
geopandas
pathlib
pkg-resources
rioxarray
urllib3
```

_Here_: The package click must to be locked to 7.x, because the currently used datacube version (=1.8.3) stops working when being used with click 8.x

#### Analyse dependencies

Using `pipdeptree`, the dependency tree of your project can better analysed and visualized than with `pip freeze`.

* Better `requirements.txt`:

  * List only **top level dependencies**:

    ```sh
    pipdeptree --python .venv/bin/python --freeze --warn silence | grep -E '^[a-zA-Z0-9\-]+'
    ```

  * List **dependencies and their relationships** `pip` friendly:

    ```sh
    pipdeptree --python .venv/bin/python --freeze
    ```

    This file will contain a lot of duplicates (no problem for pip).

* Analyse your dependencies:

  * List **complete tree**:

    ```sh
    pipdeptree --python .venv/bin/python
    ```

    This outputs the complete tree and for each dependency a version range in addition to the installed version.

  * List **reverse dependencies**:

    ```sh
    pipdeptree --python .venv/bin/python --reverse --packages click
    ```

#### pip && docker

When using python on docker images, pip comes in handy, but some recommendations are good to follow.

1. Don't use venv because docker already isolates everything.

1. Ignore "_pip run as root_" warnings.

1. Use the following command line parameter:

   * `--disable-pip-version-check`
   * `--no-cache-dir`
   * `-r requirements.txt`

1. Install system requirements beforehand.

1. Use pip to install the latest or required package versions. E.g. debian `python-` packages might not fulfill your version requirements.

#### pip vs. conda

  >pip installs *python* packages within *any* environment; conda installs *any* package within *conda* environments. If all you are doing is installing *Python packages* within an *isolated environment,* conda and pip+virtualenv are mostly interchangeable, [...]

  [https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/)

### Conda
#### Important commands

Package manager which installs packages (not only Python packages!) into conda environments.
[Conda](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#conda) is used most often via one of the following two software distributions: Anaconda, Miniconda.
Note that Anaconda is a distribution for scientific computing that installs many additional packages beyond just conda. If only conda is needed, miniconda is the preferred option.

**Note**: conda environments are not necessarily isolated from the host system as they may use site-packages from there. To make sure not to use host site-packages you can set the following environment variable: `export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=True` (this behavior was experienced with Ubuntu+Miniconda).

* **Create** a new conda environment

  ```sh
  conda create --name conda_env_name
  ```

* **Create** a new conda environment from **environment.yml** file

  ```sh
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```

  Example file:

  ```sh
  name: environment_name
  channels:
    - conda-forge
    - defaults
  dependencies:
    - python=3.6
    - numpy=1.9.*
    - flask
  ```

  Note: it is possible to install packages from specific channels by prepending the channel name, e.g. `conda-forge::numpy`

* **Remove** an existing conda environment

  ```sh
  conda remove --name conda_env_name --all
  ```

* **List** all known conda environments

  ```sh
  conda info -e
  ```

* **Activate** a conda environemnt

  ```sh
  conda activate conda_env_name
  ```

  An activated conda environment is indicated in the terminal like this

  ```sh
  (conda_env_name)$
  ```

* **Deactivate** a conda environment

  ```sh
  conda deactivate
  ```

* **Clean**, remove unused packages (packages which are not used in *any* environment) and caches

  ```sh
  conda clean --all
  ```

* **Install** a package

  ```sh
  conda install package_name
  ```

  Useful parameters
  * `--name` or `-n`: sets the conda environment where the package(s) should be installed, default is the currently activated environment
  * `--channel` or `-c`: defines additional channels to search for packages, ff no additional channel is provided the defaults or channels from `.condarc` are used.
  * `--freeze-installed, --no-update-deps`: do not update already-installed dependencies

* **Update** a package

  ```sh
  conda update package_name
  ```
  #### Best practices
  ##### Channels
  Packages can be retrieved from different channels. Most famous channels are:
  * [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda)
  * [R](https://anaconda.org/r)
  * [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
  * [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)
  
  Mixing packages from different channels, may lead to package conflicts. To avoid common problems you should consider some aspects listed below:
  * conda-forge should be first choice, since it is community driven and has a higher chance to find up-to-date packages. In addition, for the default Anaconda channel, "heavy commercial usage" requires charging (https://www.anaconda.com/blog/sustaining-our-stewardship-of-the-open-source-data-science-community). However, in some cases, the latest version of some famous data science frameworks are only provided by dedicated channels (e.g. currently, Tensorflow v2.5.0 is only available in the Anaconda repository, latest PyTorch version is provided by a dedicated [pytorch channel](https://anaconda.org/pytorch))
  * You can add your favorite channels to your default channel list with `conda config --add channels <channel-name>` and set a strict channel priority with `conda config --set channel_priority strict`. It is recommended to add conda-forge to your default channels, so that any package that is installed with `conda install <package-name>` will be retrieved from this channel. If you still need any package from another channel, you can specifiy it with `conda install -c <channel-name> <package-name>`.


### Virtual Environments

#### venv

Lightweight virtual environment with its own Python binary and (isolated) site directories.

* **Create** a new environment

  ```sh
  python3 -m venv path/to/venv
  ```

* **Remove** an existing environment

  ```sh
  rm -r path/to/venv
  ```

* **Activate** an environment

  ```sh
  source path/to/venv/bin/activate
  ```

  An activated environment is indicated in the terminal like this

  ```sh
  (venv_name)$
  ```

  Packages can then be installed, e.g., via [pip](#pip).

* **Deactivate** an environment

  ```sh
  deactivate
  ```

#### pipenv

[`pipenv`](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) tries to become the official dependency and environment management tool for python. It combines `pip` und `venv`.
